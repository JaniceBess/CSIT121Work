        Two labs gave e the opportunity to display my interest 
        in the African American experience.  One lab involved 
        using images and the different types of images. 
    </p> 
    <p>
     The other lab asked me to examine a website and 
     point out its strengths and weaknesses based on established 
     web standards.  I learned that not all websites and pages
     adhere to the standards.  Tooo many clicks to get 
     to information, broken links, and other issues
     plague some of the best looking webpages. It's not 
     just aabout style, it is also about functionality.
