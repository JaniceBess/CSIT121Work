        <h2>
            Who is the site's target audience?
        <p style="color:black">
            The site's target audience is anyone interested in the history of African American history culture, with an emphasis on Marylanders.
        </p>
        </h2>

        <h2>
            How is the site organized? 
        <p style="color:black">
            This website uses a linear organization.        
        </p>
        </h2>

        <h2>
            Which CRAP Design Principle does the use? Provide at least one example. 
        <p style="color:black">
            On the <a href="https://www.lewismuseum.org/">Home Page</a>, the site uses the principle of contrast to differentiate the sections.        
        </p>

        <h2>
            What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?
        <p style="color:black">
            This site’s Audit Score is 51 percent.  
            Issues can be found in the following areas        
        </p>
        <ul style="color: white">
            <li>Interaction and Navigation</li>  
            <li>Screen Reader and Assistive Technology</li>

        <h2>
            What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?
        <p style="color:black">
            The site is mostly effective; however, I did find a page that seems to be a dead link: 
            <a href="https://lewismuseum.pastperfectonline.com/Home/ContactAdmin">https://lewismuseum.pastperfectonline.com/Home/ContactAdmin</a>
         </p>
        </h2>

        <h2>
            What is the site's efficiency? Can users perform tasks quickly? 
        <p style="color:black">
            In my opinion, the site is only minimally efficient.  While it may take less than three clicks to get to a page under a heading, there are more links on that page that lead to the actual information.       
        </p>
        </h2>

        <h2>
            How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?
        <p style="color:black">
            I did not enjoy using the site because it seemed like I was mining for information.  I would probably go to another museum’s website to see if it were easier to find information on exhibits, events, etc. 
            In contrast, the <a href="https://artbma.org/">Baltimore Museum of Art</a> website is easier to use and arranged more efficiently.     
        </p>

        <h2>
            Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.
        <p style="color:black">
            One recommendation would be to get rid of the “fluff” and be more straightforward with their information.  Whoever designed the site seemed to be more focused on the look of the site than the useability.  While the colors and images do make it interesting to view, 
            they do not directly or indirectly give insight into what the museum has to offer.
