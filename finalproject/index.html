        <h2> My Lab Projects</h2>
    <p>
        I was hesitant to take a web design class again, 
        since I had one in my undergrad years. However, being 
        an IT major, I am aware that technology is an everchanging science.

        So, in order to satisfy the Information Systems certificate,
        I took on web design again hoping to learn new information. 
        Each lesson taught me more and more.
