            <p>From first impressions, it seems coding is not difficult.  I've also learned that an overload of information at one time is, and has always been, challenging for me.  In order for me to learn, I need to master small chunks of information at a time, figure out what that means, then apply it to the next step in a process. With HTML, while I enjoy the success of getting the results I should on a task, I think more practice is necessary.  Similar to learning a new language, one cannot be expected to communicate effectively after a couple of interactions or a few experiences speaking the new language.

          <h3 class="center"><b>What I Learned: HTML</b></h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>the difference between an ordered list and an unordered list</li>
                <li>coding by hand instead of copy & paste is a better way to learn, and</li> 
                <li>a lot of thought is needed to construct even the simplest web page.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Learning about lists, unordered and ordered, and file paths were also exciting.  I learned a lot from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a></li>
            </ul>

    Integrating CSS and HTML creates the most robust webpages we've created in class to date. 
    Using colors, different fonts, and adding borders are the "fun" things involved in created websites and web pages. 
    The knowledge I've gained over the passt three weeks makes me think I could creaate a website, albeit a simple website.
   </p>
    <h3 class="center"><b>What I Learned: CSS</b></h3>
        <ol>
        <li>how to format text using font-family</li>
        <li>adding color to all elements of the HTML can be done in one style</li> 
        <li>that creating a CSS stylesheet is better than inline formatting</li>
         </ol>
    <p id="series">
       Learning about margins, paddings, and height/width was also exciting.  I learned a lot from:
    </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding">Mozilla</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp">W3Schools</a></li>

    This lesson was the most information we've learned at one time. The way I handled the large volume of information was to take some time each time to read and digest one section at a time. 
    I think the most interesting section was reading about how code determines how a webpage is seen on different media. Before this class it was just my assumption that websites automatically made adjustments
    when the media changed.  Knowing the power is in the hands of the web designer, makes it seem less like "magic" and more like skill.

    I learned the most from the YouTube videos in this lesson:
