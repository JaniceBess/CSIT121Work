        How is the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Used?
        </h1>

     <p>
        Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) defines how 
        grammars are used by speech recognizers. These grammars tell 
        a recognizer what words and phrases to expect from a speaker, 
        enabling applications to understand and respond to speech input.

        Here are some examples:
</p>
     <h3 style="color:blue;"><i>Voice User Interfaces</i></h3>
     <p>A Voice User Interface (VUI) is a technology that enables users to 
      interact with devices or systems using voice commands and natural language.</p>

     <h3 style="color:blue;"><i>XSpeech-to-Text Systems</i></h3>
     <p>Speech to text systems is also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
      ASR are software tools that convert spoken language into written text. The top five speech-to-text apps 
      are Dragon Professional, Otter, Verbit, Speechmatics, an Braina Pro. This list
     </p>

     <h3 style="color:blue;"><i>Voice Search</i></h3>
     <p>Voice Search allows users to perform searches using voice commands instead of typing.
      The process has three steps: 1. The user speaks their search query into a microphone, 
      2. Speech recognition technology converts the spoken words into text, then 
      3. The text query is then sent the users chosen search engine.
      The search engine then processes the query and returns the results.
