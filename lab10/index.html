            <p>
                Speech Recognition Grammar Specification is a W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium)standard for how speech recognition 
                grammars are specified. A speech recognition grammar is a set of word patterns, and 
                tells a speech recognition system what to expect a human to say.
            </p>

         <p>
        The primary use of a speech recognizer grammar is to permit a speech application to 
        indicate to a recognizer what it should listen for, specifically words that may be spoken, 
        patterns in which those words may occur, and spoken language of each word.
