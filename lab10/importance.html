        What is the Importance of Speech Recognition Grammar Specification?
        </h1>  
     </header>

        <p>
            Speech recognition grammar specifications are crucial because they define 
            the structure and meaning of user utterances, enabling accurate and efficient 
            processing of speech by speech recognition systems. They guide the recognizer 
            in identifying specific words, phrases, and patterns, ultimately improving the 
            system's ability to understand and respond to spoken commands or requests. 
        </p>

            <th>Defining Allowed Input</th>
            <td>specify the allowed words, phrases, and sentence structures that the speech
                 recognizer should be able to understand.</td>

          <td>providing a framework for acceptable speech patterns, grammars enhance the accuracy of 
            speech recognition</td>

                based on the spoken command or reques</td>
