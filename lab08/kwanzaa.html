<p>Kwanzaa is an annual celebration of African-American culture from December 26th to January 1st.</p>
<p>
    Maulana Karenga, an Africana studies professor, created Kwanzaa in 1966, as an alternative to Christmas. 
However, Christian and non-christian African-Americans can celebrate Kwanzaa. </p>
<p>   
    According to Professor Karenga, Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning "first fruits."
</p>
The six principles of Kwanzaa are:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Umoja (Unity):</strong> To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.</li>
    <li><strong>Kujichagulia (Self-determination):</strong> To define and name ourselves, as well as to create and speak for ourselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Ujima (Collective work and responsibility):</strong>o build and maintain our community together and make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems and to solve them together.</li>
    <li><strong>Ujamaa (Cooperative economics):</strong>To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.</li>
    <li><strong>Nia (Purpose):</strong>To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.</li>
    <li><strong>Kuumba (Creativity):</strong>To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.</li>
    <li><strong>Imani (Faith):</strong>To believe with all our hearts in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why I chose this Image</h2>
<p>I chose this image because of the luminosity of the candles and the brilliance of the whole .GIF. The colors, again, reflect the African-American Flag.
