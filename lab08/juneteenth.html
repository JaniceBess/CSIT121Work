<p>
    Even though the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in 1863, it could not be implemented in places still under Confederate control. </p>
<p>
    In western Texas, which was a Confederate State,slaves would not be free until 
    June 19, 1865, when Union troops went to Galveston Bay announcing that 250,000 slaves were free by executive decree.</p>
<p>   
    The newly freed slaves named that day as "Juneteenth.""

<h2>Why I chose this Image</h2>
<p>
I chose this image again because it holds the colors of the African-American Flag: Red, black, and green, 
but also because it shows black wrists freed from the shackles of slavery.
